      <h3>Honeywell: Client – In House - 2019 June - 2021 August</h3>

      <h3>Project: HIVE</h3>
      <p>
        All Experion System network configuration for an FTE community needs to
        be configured in Configuration Studio. Network configuration prior to
        Experion R520 was done in Control Builder and had to be repeated across
        multiple Experion clusters especially when there were more than one
        Experion server clusters in the same FTE Community. With the
        introduction of C300 (PCNT05), CN100, and Control HIVE, additional
        network configuration is necessary to ensure further segregation of
        supervisory traffic from control, IO, and hive management communication.

      <h3>Project: EUCN (Experion Unified Engineering Tool)</h3>
      <p>
        Experion Unified Engineering Tools provide the ability to configure AM
        points and CL applications from Control Builder. This enables a unified
        environment to build points for all types of controllers in Experion,
        thus integrating the ELCN/EUCN Nodes easily and quickly into Experion.
      </p>
      <h4>Roles and Responsibilities:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As a Developer & Tech Lead, responsible for Support of Framework to

      <h3>Project: CAB (Custom Algorithm Block)</h3>
      <p>
        Custom Algorithm Block (CAB) functionality enables users to address
        process control problems that are not easily supported with standard
        function blocks. Honeywell’s robust CAB development environment allows
        the creation of custom control strategies to offer flexible and tight
        control, resulting in lower production costs and higher yields.
